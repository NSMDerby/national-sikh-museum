During the 1980s a number of young Sikhs went on field trips to London museums and places of Anglo-Sikh interest up and down the country organised by SCYS (Sikh Community and Youth Service), Nottingham.<br><br>

Nearly three decades later, these Sikhs, pioneer to tell the British-Sikh version of their heritage in a modern setting.<br><br>

The core team has a local and national presence from West Midlands, Warwickshire, London, West Yorkshire and East Midlands.<br><br>

The strategy of leaving a hard legacy to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji (Sikh holy scriptures) has been achieved by the creation of the first National Sikh Museum.<br><br>

Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Derby has catalysed this energy and commitment to setup the first National Sikh Heritage Centre and Holocaust Museum.<br><br>

Our agenda is simple and unbias –to conserve, preserve, interpret, promote and inspire the special British-Sikh relationship like never before.<br><br>

We do this not to relish in personal glory or satisfy political agendas, we do this because we want to make a difference.<br><br>

# OUR ACHIEVEMENTS
The agenda started with the Sikh Community and Youth Service, Nottingham who engineered and delivered this museum with the wider British-Sikh community. Their journey began over two decades ago and achievements include:

- Pioneering ‘Voyages of Discovery’ in 1986 with young people to research UK places of Anglo-Sikh significance; this led to the publication of a resource book in 1994 which described UK connections with Anglo-Sikh history
- Developing a well received touring exhibition titled ‘Warm, Rich and Fearless.’ It was hosted at Nottingham Castle, London, Birmingham, Leeds and other UK locations
- Arranged the first Panthic (Sikh nation) viewing of the canons of Maharajah Ranjeet Singh at the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Loughbourgh. An estimated 50,000 Sangat (congregation) attended this Samagam (event) –this was the largest celebration outside of India
- The creation of educational packs in line with the UK national curriculum. We look forward to working with schools and colleges
