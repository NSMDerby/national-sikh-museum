National Sikh Museum in Derby is a place that celebrates the rich and diverse history of the Sikh community in Britain. Our story began over three decades ago when a group of young Sikhs embarked on a journey of discovery to learn more about their heritage. Organized by the Sikh Community and Youth Service in Nottingham, these field trips took them to London museums and places of Anglo-Sikh interest across the country.

Inspired by their experiences, these young Sikhs sought to tell the British-Sikh version of their heritage in a modern setting. Today, the core team behind the National Sikh Museum has a local and national presence, spanning the West Midlands, Warwickshire, London, West Yorkshire, and the East Midlands.

Our museum was created with a specific purpose in mind - to leave a lasting legacy in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh holy scriptures. And thanks to the energy and commitment of the Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Derby, the first National Sikh Heritage Centre and Holocaust Museum was born.

At the National Sikh Museum, our agenda is simple and unbiased - to conserve, preserve, interpret, promote, and inspire the special British-Sikh relationship like never before. We do this not for personal gain or political agendas, but to make a difference.

Our objectives are equally clear: to articulate the story of the Sikhs, beginning in the times of the Gurus through to modern times in a fresh, informative, and inspirational manner; to promote community cohesion, tolerance, and mutual understanding with the Anglo-Sikh experience and disappearing heritage of Punjab; to tell the Sikh Holocaust story with a view to highlighting the dangers of religious, cultural, ethnic, race, linguistic, national, and political intolerance; and to be the partner of first choice with key museums and libraries in the UK and overseas.

We also aim to host temporary exhibitions, seminars, workshops, and lectures; to be recognized as a center of excellence in the collection, conservation, preservation, and interpretation of Sikh heritage in the UK and overseas; to serve people of all ages, regardless of background and culture; to develop a renowned reference library and archive; to develop educational packs in line with the national curriculum with a view to host educational visits; to build a loyal and creative workforce who can conserve, preserve, and interpret in an innovative environment; and to promote tourism to central England.

Our achievements speak for themselves. We have pioneered 'Voyages of Discovery' since 1986, which took young people on field trips to research UK places of Anglo-Sikh significance. This led to the publication of a resource book in 1994 which described UK connections with Anglo-Sikh history. We have also developed a well-received touring exhibition titled 'Warm, Rich and Fearless', which was hosted at Nottingham Castle, London, Birmingham, Leeds, and other UK locations.

In addition, we arranged the first Panthic viewing of the canons of Maharajah Ranjeet Singh at the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji in Loughborough. An estimated 50,000 Sangat (congregation) attended this Samagam (event) - the largest celebration outside of India. We have also created educational packs in line with the UK national curriculum, and we look forward to working with schools and colleges.

We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are committed to continuing our work to celebrate and promote the rich heritage of the Sikh community in Britain. We hope that you will join us on this journey of discovery and inspiration.
